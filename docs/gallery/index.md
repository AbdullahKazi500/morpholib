You can find links to various short animations below. Click on them to see the animation play and also the code used to create it. They cover a reasonably wide breadth of Morpho's functionality.

- Morphing grids
- Sliding tangent line
- Pendulum
- Epicycle
- Torus construction
- Mean Value Theorem

For more animations (at full-scale, production quality), take a look at the [Morphocular](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7Zwf4X_OQ-TEnou0zdyRA) and [Serpentine Integral](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo-H6EyTbD-7inMwW70QdtA) YouTube channels, which use Morpho to create most of the animations.
