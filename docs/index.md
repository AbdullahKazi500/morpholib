## Guides

For a quick-ish way to get yourself familiar with how Morpho works and how to create animations, [take a look at the guides](https://morpho-matters.github.io/morpholib/guides/).

## Gallery

A gallery of animations (along with code) demonstrating some of Morpho's capabilities can be found [on this page](https://morpho-matters.github.io/morpholib/gallery/).

You can also take a look at the [Morphocular](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7Zwf4X_OQ-TEnou0zdyRA) and [Serpentine Integral](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo-H6EyTbD-7inMwW70QdtA) YouTube channels, which use Morpho to create most of the animations.
