# Morpho Guides

Below you can find a collection of guides to help you get familiar with how Morpho works and how to use it. I recommend following them pretty much in the following order:

- Guide 1: Basics
- Guide 2: Useful Figures and Gadgets
- Guide 3: Animation In-depth
- Guide 4: Skits

Example code is provided in each guide, which I would encourage you to code up manually, as I think that will help you learn it better than merely copying and pasting the code. However, finished versions of the examples can be found [on this page](https://github.com/morpho-matters/morpholib/tree/master/examples) if you just want to quickly try them out or debug your own code.

Also note that these guides are not at all comprehensive, and I plan to add more guides in the future. But also keep in mind that they are merely *guides* and do not count as full-scale documentation of all aspects of Morpho and its capabilities. They are meant to hopefully quickly get you able to create your own animations.
