# Morpho Guides

Below you can find a collection of guides to help you get familiar with how Morpho works and how to use it. I recommend following them pretty much in the following order:

### Fundamentals
- [Basics](https://morpho-matters.github.io/morpholib/guides/basic-guide)
- [Useful Figures and Gadgets](https://morpho-matters.github.io/morpholib/guides/figures-and-gadgets)
- [Animation In-depth](https://morpho-matters.github.io/morpholib/guides/animation-in-depth) (possibly skippable if you're in a hurry)
- [Skits](https://morpho-matters.github.io/morpholib/guides/skits)
- Incorporating LaTeX (coming soon!)

### Advanced
- [Making Longer-Form Videos](https://morpho-matters.github.io/morpholib/guides/projects)

Example code is provided in each guide, which I would encourage you to code up manually, as I think that will help you learn it better than merely copying and pasting the code. However, finished versions of the examples can be found [on this page](https://github.com/morpho-matters/morpholib/tree/master/examples) if you want to just quickly try them out or debug your own code.

Also note that these guides are not at all comprehensive, and I plan to add more guides in the future. But also keep in mind that they are merely *guides* and do not count as full-scale documentation of all aspects of Morpho and its capabilities. They are meant to hopefully quickly get you able to create your own animations.
